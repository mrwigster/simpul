# Simpul Framework

## By @MrWigster (alex-wigmore.co.uk)

A simple and very effective starter framework.

gulp is at the core to power the sass, create a simple PHP server and live-reloading with browsersync.

By default it has the header/footer/menu includes that 99% of most websites will utilise as well as some basic styling to help you get your project/site/app off the ground very quickly.

It features both flex AND grid for CSS structuring.

**Important** things to change when you start:
* sass/_vars.scss : Change the variables here to suit your needs. Eg, update the font-families, $brand colour etc
* inc/config.php : Change the variables here.
* Add Google Analytics ID into the inc/header.php section.
* Edit 383 - 408 of the .htaccess file to make it relevant to your project. I.e Either force "www." or remove them, as well as HTTPS or non-http.
