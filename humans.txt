"Simpul" HTML/PHP/SASS starting template to very quickly get your project off the ground.

It's semi-opinionated, in that it has a basic header/footer setup with how 99% of most modern websites will have them.

Created by Alex / @guwii, utilising the both Flex and Grid as a framework and powered using a gulp setup.
